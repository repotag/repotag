[GENERAL]
- Add options to the create/edit views of repositories to add users for a particular role (read vs write access).
- Add User Groups?
- On the Dashboard, restrict the list of available repositories to the ones the current user has access to (currently all repos are visible).
- Create an administration-page for User Management (CRUD operations, using ActiveAdmin DSL).
- Create an administration-page for Resource Management (using ActiveAdmin DSL).
- Think of a good way to restrict individual repositories in size (storage cap).

[FILEBROWSER]
- Add a button to show the last commit message (off by default).
- Add the possibility to view a diff of two arbitrary revisions of a file (on file level, maybe using dropdowns). 
- Fix the File Browser not to show arbitrary files such as /etc/passwd.
- Add a dropdown menu to the Filebrowser which available branches to browse.

[JGIT]
- Extend the JGit Ruby Wrapper (based on Git4J, proposal for new name, RJGit.)
- Use the JGit library to extract a file tree from a particular branch of a repository (start with "master" branch).
- Use JGit to create new Git repositories, both on disk as in ActiveRecord (use the create controller action).

[COMMIT HOOKS]
- Add a method (using JGit?) to add commit hooks to git repositories.
- Write some basic commit hook scripts to replace Gitblit's Groovy scripts (e.g. mailer).
- Add an option to the create/edit views of repositories to add commit hooks to repositories.
- Work out a way so that administrators can add their own commit hooks (external folder?).

[SYNCHRONIZATION]
- Work out a way to update the 'updated-at' field of a repository in ActiveRecord each time a commit is made through the git-servlet.

[AUTHENTICATION]
- Configure the Devise gem to include OAUTH2 and OpenID authentication methods.
- Add an administrator-page to the interface in which different authentication schemes can be enabled (Google, Facebook, AD, LDAP).

[EMAIL]
- Set up an email mechanism (preferably using an existing gem or Rails built-in mailers).
- Add an admin-page to the interface to configure SMTP settings for the mailer. Save these settings on disk (preferably in one central config file).
- Design an invitation mechanism with which to add users (identified by email address) to repositories and let these users know about the invitation by email.

[OTHER]
- Write a method that returns an Array of all repositories that haven't been updated for X amount of time.
- See if there are any extensions for the coderay-gem to include (e.g. highlighting for bash scripts).
- Write a method that merges two user accounts together in a sensible way.
